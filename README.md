GlowUp Trainer 💪
Overview

GlowUp Trainer is a web application that generates personalized workout and nutrition plans for each user.
Instead of giving the same generic routine to everyone, the app creates unique plans tailored to the individual based on their personal inputs.

What the App Does

Collects user information such as:

Name
Height
Weight
Age
Sex
Goals (fat loss, muscle gain, maintenance, etc.)
Sends this information to the ChatGPT API
Receives a custom workout and diet plan generated specifically for that user
Displays the plan instantly in the browser
Because the app uses AI, every user receives a different plan depending on their body stats and goals.

Demonstrates my skills in full-stack development and API integration
It also serves uses portfolio project to show real-world use of:

Backend logic
Frontend forms
